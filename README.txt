# Overview
This program allows users to open, apply certain operations on their images and save the altered images. Operations can be applied by clicking menu items or buttons or by typing in a batch of commands and then execute.

# Features and Their Applications
The available operations on images include blur, sharpen, grayscale, sepia, dither, mosaic, edge detection, greyscale enhancement, image cropping, and generating image of stripped rainbows, checkboards, and national flags of certain countries.
